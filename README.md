# Homework Assignment Module 10 - SQLAlchemy and Flask

## Description

`climate_start.ipynb` contains SQLAlchemy queries of the `hawaii.sqlite` database for weather stations, temperatures, and chronological data, as well as graphs representing some of that data.

`app.py` is a small Flask program that creates an API that allows a user to query that data, as instructed.

## Notes

One of the API query directions was a tiny bit unclear, and another I kinda didn't see the point of, as written. I commented about them inside `app.py`.

I will defend myself by saying I *technically* did follow directions.
